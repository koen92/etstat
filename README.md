# ETstat

This is a simple program to browse Wolfenstein Enemy Territory servers. It uses
[Qstat](https://github.com/multiplay/qstat) to query the master server (make
sure to have that installed).

This was a simple example program for me to learn Python and QT4 (so don't
expect great code quality...), but maybe (parts of) it can be useful for others.
